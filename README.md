# target_sql_case_study

In this project, I analyzed a dataset of 100,000 e-commerce orders from 2016 to 2018 for a leading retail company in Brazil. 
Using SQL, I uncovered key trends in customer behavior, pricing variations, and shipping preferences. 
By implementing Joins, Sub Queries, and Common Table Expressions (CTE), I established relationships between multiple data sources. 
My analysis revealed a consistent 20% year-over-year increase in sales within Brazil's Target market, pointing to significant growth opportunities.
